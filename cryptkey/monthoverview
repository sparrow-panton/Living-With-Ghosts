### What This Shows:
- **Before:** The day-to-day micro-chaos, moods, and progress.
- **After:** One line holds the whole month’s memory and meaning.
- Anyone joining your project *later* can actually catch up (without reading your entire neurodivergent diary).

## Why This Fucking Rocks

- **Transparency:** Everyone can see how the sausage gets made.
- **Compression:** You don’t lose any essence, but you save yourself 50,000 words and three migraines.
- **Accessibility:** Future you (and your ghosts) can orient in minutes, not hours.
- **Proof:** Look! The system *works* — your haunted ledger gets lighter, not heavier.
